    "versionText": "This topic branch adds a new ai model. This ai model is simulation based, so it plays every card in it's hand in a simulation of the game in order to find the best card.\n\nTHIS AI MODEL IS UNFINISHED. IT IS IN FIRST-PASS AND SO WILL CAUSE MEMORY LEAKS, CRASHES AND BUGS. THIS MODEL TAKES FOREVER, USES UP A LOT OF MEMORY, AND CURRENTLY THE ONLY NEW THINGS THE AI DOES IS PLAY CARDS, ATTACK, SELECT TARGETS, DISCOVER. EVERYTHING ELSE IS HANDLED BY THE PREVIOUS MODEL.",
