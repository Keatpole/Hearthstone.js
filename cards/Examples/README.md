# Examples
These are some example cards to (hopefully) teach you how to create your own cards in Hearthstone.js

You can give yourself any of these cards by having debug mode enabled (`config/general.json`), and typing `/give The Card's Name`.

Every stage has a big example card at the end, called `combined.js`. This will show you every concept you learned in that stage, so look at that last.

In all stages, there is a README.md file. This shows you the order to look at the cards in. This is important since the card files won't explain a concept if it has already been explained in a card before it.

1. Look at the cards in `1`. These are the essentials, showing you the structure of cards.
2. Look at the cards in `2`. These are a bit more advanced, where you will be modifying some values.
3. Look in `3`. This is where you will write more actual code. (It can get overwhelming quick, sorry)
4. Look in `4`. These are the most advanced concepts so far
5. Look in `DIY`. These are DIY cards.
