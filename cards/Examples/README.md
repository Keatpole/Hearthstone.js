# Examples
These are some example cards to (hopefully) teach you how to create your own cards in Hearthstone.js

You can give yourself any of these cards by having debug mode enabled (`config/general.json`), and typing `/give The Card's Name`.

You won't begin writing/looking at code until the examples in `3`.

Every stage has a big example card at the end, called `combined.js`. This will show you every concept you learned in that stage, so look at that last.

1. Look at the cards in `1`. These are the essentials, showing you the structure of cards.
2. Look at the cards in `2`. These are a bit more advanced, where you will be modifying some values.
3. Look in `3`. This is where you will first write actual code. (It can get overwhelming quick, sorry)
4. Look in `4`. These are the most advanced concepts so far.
