For step 1:
Look in `game.interact`. There is a further hint down below.

For step 2:
Look at the different methods for the target.

`game.interact.selectTarget` is the method to use.
Make sure to set the `target` to the return value.

Criterias to solve the card are the following:
1. You NEED to use `game.interact.selectTarget`.
2. When using `game.interact.selectTarget`, you need to set the following parameters:
    a. `elusive` = true            // The card is a spell, so elusive minions should be spared
    b. `force_side` = null         // Don't force a side. The description says: Choose a minion. Not: Choose a FRIENDLY minion, or Choose an ENEMY minion.
    c. `force_class` = "minion"    // Only allow minions to be targetted, the user isn't allowed to target the enemy hero, for example.
    d. Don't set `flags`           // No special flags
3. You need to have set the `target` variable, and it needs to be killed (no health and in the graveyard).
