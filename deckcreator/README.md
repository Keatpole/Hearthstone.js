# Deck Creator
To run, open setup.bat, then run.bat. Once opened, type 'help' to view commands.

Make sure to look at the config to see if your deck is valid.

Keep in mind that if you have runes, cards that are not compatible with your runes will be hidden.

Once you're done, type 'deckcode', then copy the text into Hearthstone.js.
Enjoy.
